/**
*
* Methodology For Variables
*			Variables are information storage that can store yes/no, numbers, and letters
* i is a boolean indicator (shorthand for if)
*			- Booleans are basically on off switches that are either true or false
* n(S,I,L) is an indicator for an integer type variable (shorthand for number [short, integer,long])
*			- a integer variable is a variable that only takes integers, so whenever it gets a decimal, it rounds downs
* f(L,D) is a float type indicator (shorthand for float[float, double])
*			- a float variable handles decimals and is larger than int, and long
* s is a string indicator (shorthand for string)
*			- String variables store letters and numbers, but are hard to use in programs
* m is a macro indicator (surprise, its shorthand for macros)
* 		- Macros are really just standins for other values to make programs easier to read
*

/**
*
* Methodology For Functions
*			Functions are a series of commands that can do any number of things, from driving the robot to determining the robot's position
* v is a void indicator (shorthand for void)
*			- Voids are functions that don't give anything as result and really only do the commands given to it.
* i is a boolean return indicator (using the same variable methodology)
* 		- Boolean return functions return a boolean value
* n(s,i,l) is an integer return indicator (again, see above)
*			- Integer return functions return a integer value
* f(l,d) is a float type return indicator (take a wild guess)
*			- Float return functions return, drumroll please, float values.
* @param defines the parameters and their ranges
